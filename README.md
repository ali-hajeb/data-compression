# Data Compression Algorithms
Data compression algorithms are techniques that reduce the size of data while preserving its original information. They are crucial for efficient storage, transmission, and processing of data. These algorithms can be broadly categorized as lossless or lossy, with lossless algorithms retaining all original data, while lossy algorithms sacrifice some data to achieve higher compression ratios. Common examples include Huffman coding, Run-Length Encoding, and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW).
In this repository, I try to implement some of the common algorithms using c language.
